# pioled

A series of experiments with a small OLED screen for Raspberry Pi.

### spotify_screen/

Spotify playback visualizer powered by the Spotify API with a Flask frontend.

### draw/

Powered by flask and WebSockets, the Pi hosts a page with a spring canvas.
Anything drawn on the canvas will be reflected on the OLED.

### galleryapp/

The Pi serves a webpage with flask that allows the user to grab an image
from a URL and upload it to the Pi, which then applies a dithering algorithm
and draws the result on the OLED

**Perpetual work in progress, I have more ideas for when I return to the Pi.**
